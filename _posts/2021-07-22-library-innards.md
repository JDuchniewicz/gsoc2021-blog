## What exactly happens under the hood

This post aims to delve deeper into how the library works. Topics closely related to **EGL**, **GLES** and **GPU** vs **CPU** computing will be elaborated on here.

First of all, the library's aim is to utilize BBB's GPU block for computations. In **OpenGL ES 3.0** we have _compute shaders_ which can be used to perform computations utilizing GPUs. Also **OpenCL** is used for heterogeneous computations on general platforms, such as PC or embedded devices running Linux operating System. Since BBB's GPU chips (SGX530) don't support **OpenGL ES 3.0** but support it's **2.0** version, we have to utilize  _vertex_ and _fragment_ shaders for our computations.

This is the old-school way of doing **GPGPU** computing before _compute shaders_ were introduced. The data goes through _vertex shader_ and then the actual computation happen in _fragment shader_. There of course remain some key decision and issues that have to be tackled, such as data format used for computations, size of the data to be computed and some GPU limitations (such as [inability to sample textures in branches on SGX architectures](https://forums.imgtec.com/t/gradient-calculation-inside-a-conditional-block/3404/5?u=jduchniewicz)).

This post will feature a lot of abbreviations which may be cryptic at first (or not if you are familiar with the Linux graphics stack). If you feel you are stuck and do not understand them, please refer to [this post](https://blog.mecheye.net/2012/06/the-linux-graphics-stack/). (I of course did not find all of my answers there but at least had a stronger understanding thanks to it).

### Context creation
When we usually render something we need a _context_ which, citing Apple's developer pages is:

> a container for state information. When you designate a rendering context as the current rendering context, subsequent OpenGL commands modify that contextâ€™s state, objects attached to that context, or the drawable object associated with that context. The actual drawing surfaces are never owned by the rendering context but are created, as needed, when the rendering context is actually attached to a drawable object. 

In our case we are using **EGL** to create and manage our context. More specifically we use a pixel buffer which is an off-screen rendering target, which means we do not render to any window and instead save our data in an arbitrary memory location.

The following code creates and uses the context for our library:
```c
// g_helper contains following fields:
typedef struct
{
  EProgramState state;
  GLint ESShaderProgram;
  EGLDisplay display;
  EGLConfig config;
  EGLContext context;
  EGLSurface surface;
  int height;
  int width;
} GLHelper;

GLHelper g_helper;

  g_helper.display = eglGetDisplay((EGLNativeDisplayType)0);
  if (!g_helper.display)
      ERR("Could not create display");
      
  if (eglInitialize(g_helper.display, &major, &minor) == 0)
      ERR("Could not initialize display");

  printf("EGL API version %d.%d\n", major, minor);   

  // checking the extensions and choosing a config is skipped for brevity
  
  if (eglBindAPI(EGL_OPENGL_ES_API) == 0)
    ERR("Could not bind the API"); 
    
  EGLint eglSurfaceAttibutes[] = {
        EGL_WIDTH, width,
        EGL_HEIGHT, height,
        EGL_NONE
  };
  g_helper.surface = eglCreatePbufferSurface(g_helper.display, g_helper.config, eglSurfaceAttibutes);

  if (g_helper.surface == EGL_NO_SURFACE)
      ERR("Could not create EGL surface");

  EGLint eglContextAttributes[] = {
      EGL_CONTEXT_CLIENT_VERSION, 2,
      EGL_NONE
  };

  g_helper.context = eglCreateContext(g_helper.display, g_helper.config, EGL_NO_CONTEXT, eglContextAttributes);
  if (g_helper.context == EGL_NO_CONTEXT)
      ERR("Could not create EGL context");

  if (eglMakeCurrent(g_helper.display, g_helper.surface, g_helper.surface, g_helper.context) != EGL_TRUE) // EGL_NO_SURFACE??
      ERR("Could not bind the surface to context");

  EGLint version = 0;
  eglQueryContext(g_helper.display, g_helper.context, EGL_CONTEXT_CLIENT_VERSION, &version);
  printf("EGL Context version: %d\n", version);
```

With the context set up, we can create our textures and bind them to memory and the _framebuffer object_. But before we do this, one small caveat: extensions we will be using have to be checked and **GLES** configs have to be chosen with following helper functions:

```c
int gpgpu_check_egl_extensions()
{
    int ret = 0;
    if (!g_helper.display)
        ERR("No display created!");
    const char* egl_extensions = eglQueryString(g_helper.display, EGL_EXTENSIONS);
    if (!strstr(egl_extensions, "EGL_KHR_create_context"))
        ERR("No EGL_KHR_create_context extension");
    if (!strstr(egl_extensions, "EGL_KHR_surfaceless_context"))
        ERR("No EGL_KHR_create_context extension");

bail:
    return ret;
}

int gpgpu_find_matching_config(EGLConfig* config, uint32_t gbm_format)
{
    int ret = 0;
    if (!g_helper.display)
        ERR("No display created!");

    EGLint count;
#ifndef BEAGLE
    static const EGLint config_attrs[] = {
        EGL_BUFFER_SIZE,        32,
        EGL_DEPTH_SIZE,         EGL_DONT_CARE,
        EGL_STENCIL_SIZE,       EGL_DONT_CARE,
        EGL_RENDERABLE_TYPE,    EGL_OPENGL_ES2_BIT,
        EGL_SURFACE_TYPE,       EGL_WINDOW_BIT,
        EGL_NONE
    };
#else
    static const EGLint config_attrs[] = {
        EGL_RED_SIZE, 8,
        EGL_GREEN_SIZE, 8,
        EGL_BLUE_SIZE, 8,
        EGL_ALPHA_SIZE, 8,
        EGL_SURFACE_TYPE, EGL_PBUFFER_BIT,
        EGL_RENDERABLE_TYPE, EGL_OPENGL_ES2_BIT,
        EGL_NONE
    };
#endif

    if (!eglGetConfigs(g_helper.display, NULL, 0, &count))
        ERR("Could not get number of configs");

    EGLConfig* configs = malloc(count * sizeof(EGLConfig));
    if (!eglChooseConfig(g_helper.display, config_attrs, configs, count, &count) || count < 1)
        ERR("Could not choose configs or config size < 1");

    printf("Seeked ID %d\n", gbm_format);
    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)
    {
        EGLint format;

#ifndef BEAGLE
        if (!eglGetConfigAttrib(g_helper.display, configs[i], EGL_NATIVE_VISUAL_ID, &format))
            ERR("Could not iterate through configs");
#else
        if (!eglGetConfigAttrib(g_helper.display, configs[i], EGL_CONFIG_ID, &format)) // TODO: should be matched in a more robust way
            ERR("Could not iterate through configs");
#endif

	printf("EGL format: %d Seeked: %d\n", format, gbm_format);
        dumpEGLconfig(configs[i], g_helper.display);
        if (gbm_format == format)
        {
            *config = configs[i];
            free(configs);
            return ret;
        }
    }

    ERR("Failed to find a matching config");
bail:
    if (configs)
        free(configs);
    return ret;
}
```

The config chooser wrapper needs different parameters depending whether we are using our host or the BBB. Special parameters such as bit depth and surface type have to be queried from the system and chosen.

### Framebuffer Object creation
With our context set up and running, we can now create the actual objects to which we will be rendering in terms of **OpenGL ES**. These objects as you already know are called _framebuffer objects_ or in short **FBO**s. As mentioned earlier **EGL** will be used to translate our **OpenGL ES** calls to actual platform-specific calls.

In our case, we are first creating a texture we will be rendering to(`glTexImage2D()`) and then we bind it to our current framebuffer as color attachment number 0 with `glFramebufferTexture2D()`. Finally, we check if the framebuffer was created properly, otherwise we could receive complete garbage on our rendering calls. One thing that eluded me for a long time was missing `glViewport()` call which sets the actual size of the rendering buffer and does the screen-to-buffer translations. without setting it properly you would be getting output from only a tiny fragment of the texture instead of your input width and height, rendering (_no pun intended_) this library useless.

The code is simple to follow and looks like this:
```c
int gpgpu_make_FBO()
{
    int ret = 0;
    GLuint texId, fbId;

    glGenTextures(1, &texId);
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texId);
    glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, g_helper.width, g_helper.height, 0, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, 0); // allows for floating-point buffer in ES2.0 (format should be RGBA32F)
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0);

    glGenFramebuffers(1, &fbId);
    glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, fbId);
    glFramebufferTexture2D(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0, GL_TEXTURE_2D, texId, 0);
    // magic trick!
    glViewport(0, 0, g_helper.width, g_helper.height);

    ret = glCheckFramebufferStatus(GL_FRAMEBUFFER);
    if (ret != GL_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE)
        gpgpu_report_framebuffer_status(ret);
    else
        ret = 0;

    // save the FBO texture as the primary output for chaining
    g_chainHelper.output_texId0 = texId;
    g_chainHelper.fbId = fbId;
    return ret;
}
```

### Data transfers

This is probably the crux of our library and was the most time-consuming part of the entire project: inputting the data properly and getting it back from the texture. Astute readers probably noticed that we are using **GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE**s as the format of our **FBO**. Because we are using `unsigned byte`s we probably need to do some translations our input data => GPU data format => our output data, which in the first case are simply a regular C-style cast.
