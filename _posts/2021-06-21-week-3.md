## Changing my environment
I needed to change my environment as the image I was previously using: [AM3358 Debian 10.3 2020-04-06 4GB SD IoT](https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-10.3-iot-armhf-2020-04-06-4gb.img.xz) proved not to have graphics system set up in a sufficent manner for EGL context creation.
Therefore I installed [AM3358 Debian 9.12 2020-04-06 4GB SD ImgTec](https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-9.12-imgtec-armhf-2020-04-06-4gb.img.xz) and had to configure it.

## Coding
Similarly to last week, my focus continues with getting EGL to work headless. I also need to expand my knowledge of the Linux graphics system as I want the library to _just work_ on any BB image and ideally with any BB.
This will require some tinkering around but is probably doable in the project timeframe, once the goals are satisified.

## Blog
I will write an introductory blog on the planned approach and some updates on what I did so far.
