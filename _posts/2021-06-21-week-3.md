## Changing my environment
I needed to change my environment as the image I was previously using: [AM3358 Debian 10.3 2020-04-06 4GB SD IoT](https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-10.3-iot-armhf-2020-04-06-4gb.img.xz) proved not to have graphics system set up in a sufficent manner for EGL context creation.
Therefore I installed [AM3358 Debian 9.12 2020-04-06 4GB SD ImgTec](https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-9.12-imgtec-armhf-2020-04-06-4gb.img.xz) and had to configure it.

## Coding
Similarly to last week, my focus continues with getting EGL to work headless. I also need to expand my knowledge of the Linux graphics system as I want the library to _just work_ on any BB image and ideally with any BB.
I am perusing following resources in order to learn more:
* https://blogs.igalia.com/itoral/2014/07/29/a-brief-introduction-to-the-linux-graphics-stack/
* https://people.freedesktop.org/~marcheu/linuxgraphicsdrivers.pdf
* https://blogs.igalia.com/elima/2016/10/06/example-run-an-opengl-es-compute-shader-on-a-drm-render-node/ - this one seems most related to what I am doing

This will require some tinkering around but is probably doable in the project timeframe, once the goals are satisified. It may stretch beyond the GSoC but that is expected of a package which may be mainlined/brought upstream.


## Blog
I will write an introductory blog on the planned approach and some updates on what I did so far.
