## Setting up PowerVR SDK tutorial
The step-by-step instruction on how to setup the SDK is available here

## Coding
Initially, I wanted to develop everything [in one place](https://github.com/JDuchniewicz/GPGPU-with-GLES), but because the SDK has so many dependencies moving it out proved to be challenging.
Because of that I will code the SDK related part (testing algorithm soundness on emulator) - _under_ the SDK and move it out only after I have significant progress in project. Otherwise I would get bogged down by the task and it would steal precious time.
