## Coding
* Further reading about PowerVR
* Started creating CMakefiles for two elements of my project: C API library and the application using it (for now the application uses PowerVR SDK)

## Setting the evironment
* Received BBB rev C and flashed the Debian IoT image - might change to a different distro laters as I am not a Debian lover.

### Network connection
* Set up internet connection via USB with help of packets forwarding taken from [this page](http://jpdelacroix.com/tutorials/sharing-internet-beaglebone-black.html)

The `echo` command needs to be altered, otherwise you will just see:
`-bash: /etc/resolv.conf: Permission denied`

The right command to be used:
`echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf`

Additionally the commands have to be put to a script ran at startup, for example as an entry in the crontab:
```config
sudo vim /etc/crontab
# append the following line
@reboot         root    route add default gw 192.168.7.1 && echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf
```

Also be sure to set up the host commands as a script on your host machine and also run it at startup.

Alternatively you may create a shell script:
```
#!/usr/bin/sh
sudo route add default gw 192.168.7.1 && echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf
```
And a systemd unit:
```
[Unit]
After=default.target

[Service]
Type=simple
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStart=/bin/bash /usr/bin/inet_enable.sh
TimeoutStartSec=0

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
#### Apparently neither of those worked for me (I am unable to reach beyond my gateway), so for now I am just typing the commands manually whenever I need them...

* Resized the partition following steps from [here](https://elinux.org/Beagleboard:Expanding_File_System_Partition_On_A_microSD) 
* Chose the SD card to be my `/home` partition and left the root filesystem on the built-in MMC Flash.

#### PowerVR SDK
* cloned the SDK and tried building it, with following errors (for now unsolved):
```
make[2]: *** No rule to make target '../external/PVRScope/../../lib/Linux_armv7l/libPVRScopeDeveloper.a', needed by 'bin/OpenGLESPVRScopeExample'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:1646: examples/OpenGLES/PVRScopeExample/CMakeFiles/OpenGLESPVRScopeExample.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [Makefile:130: all] Error 2
```
They were solved by following the [discussion](https://github.com/powervr-graphics/Native_SDK/issues/70) with Omar from PowerVR.

## Video
* Prepared the opening GSoC 21 presentation 
* Discussed the presentation with my mentors
* Recorded the video and uploaded it [here](https://youtu.be/I5FnOTc8OP8)

## Setting up Libera IRC with Matrix client
* We will be discussing all project related things on the #beagle-gsoc on libera.chat for transparency - I followed [this guide](https://kparal.wordpress.com/2021/06/01/connecting-to-libera-chat-through-matrix/) to set things up
