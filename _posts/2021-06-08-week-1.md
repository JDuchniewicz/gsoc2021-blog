## Coding
* Further reading about PowerVR

## Setting the evironment
* Received BBB rev C and flashed the Debian IoT image - might change to a different distro laters as I am not a Debian lover.

### Network connection
* Set up internet connection via USB with help of packets forwarding taken from [this page](http://jpdelacroix.com/tutorials/sharing-internet-beaglebone-black.html)

The `echo` command needs to be altered, otherwise you will just see:
`-bash: /etc/resolv.conf: Permission denied`

The right command to be used:
`echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf`

Additionally the commands have to be put to a script ran at startup, for example as an entry in the crontab:
```config
sudo vim /etc/crontab
# append the following line
@reboot         root    route add default gw 192.168.7.1 && echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf
```

Also be sure to set up the host commands as a script on your host machine and also run it at startup.

Alternatively you may create a shell script:
```
#!/usr/bin/sh
sudo route add default gw 192.168.7.1 && echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf
```
And a systemd unit:
```
[Unit]
After=default.target

[Service]
Type=simple
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStart=/bin/bash /usr/bin/inet_enable.sh
TimeoutStartSec=0

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
#### Apparently neither of those worked for me (I am unable to reach beyond my gateway), so for now I am just typing the commands manually whenever I need them...

* Resized the partition following steps from [here](https://elinux.org/Beagleboard:Expanding_File_System_Partition_On_A_microSD) 

## Video
* Prepared the opening GSoC 21 presentation available 
* Discussed the presentation with my mentors
*
