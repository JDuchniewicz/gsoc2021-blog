This post/page is a collection of benchmarks made both on the Beaglebone Black rev. C and my PC with NVIDIA GTX960M GPU.
On host PC the operations are performed with 32-bit buffer and on BBB with 16-bits (as of 15.07.21 support for 32-bit is on the way).

## Array addition float


## Array addition fixed-point 16-bit
