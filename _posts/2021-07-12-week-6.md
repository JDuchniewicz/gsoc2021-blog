## Hurdles with BBB ARGB8888 format
It turns out that BBB has issues with the internal ARGB8888 format used by my library for computing 32-bit floating-point operations. It returns a mysterious error which is hard to decipher:
```
Creating Window surface..
PVR:(Error): WSEGL_CreateWindowDrawable: Couldn't set CRTC: Invalid argument [0, ]
Unable to create surface
    egl error 'EGL_BAD_ALLOC' (0x3003)
```
I am right now checking why it does not work as expected - there is an [issue](https://forums.imgtec.com/t/sgx530-argb8888-support/3403) opened on Imagination forum and is under investigation. It is quite possible that it is some obsolete limitation, as the platform should be supporting such operations.

## 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic
In order to keep the project going I will be writing the 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic operations in shaders. If the 32-bit computing is unblocked, then the shaders will need only small tweaking to be working well with the larger format.
