## Hurdles with BBB ARGB8888 format
It turns out that BBB has issues with the internal ARGB8888 format used by my library for computing 32-bit floating-point operations. It returns a mysterious error which is hard to decipher:
```
Creating Window surface..
PVR:(Error): WSEGL_CreateWindowDrawable: Couldn't set CRTC: Invalid argument [0, ]
Unable to create surface
    egl error 'EGL_BAD_ALLOC' (0x3003)
```
