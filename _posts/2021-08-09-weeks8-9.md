## Coding
The last two weeks were spent mostly on my Master's Summer School where we created a startup prototype in Digital Health (and we won :), so the time was well spent!

I also continued my benchmarking work with noop benchmarks added to the [benchmarking post](https://jduchniewicz.github.io/gsoc2021-blog/posts/2021/07/15/benchmarking.html) and chain API benchmarks as well. These are probably more interesting as they show

I also wrote the [_Library Innards_ blog post](https://jduchniewicz.github.io/gsoc2021-blog/posts/2021/07/22/library-innards.html) which discusses how things are done under the hood in this library. I highly recommend reading it if you are interested in GPGPU and some nitty-gritty details of **OpenGL ES** and **EGL**.

## Debugging
During testing on BBB I found that I am unable to run the chain API more than several times and this number decreases with the algorithm complexity (less repetitions for convolutions). It seems to be related to `libglslcompiler` and memory management issues:
```
