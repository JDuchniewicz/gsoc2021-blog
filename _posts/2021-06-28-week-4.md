## Coding
### CMake polishing
I needed to update my CMake files to work properly with my BBB. It turned out that there is no OpenGL on the Imagination image for BBB and just **EGL** + **GLES**. Therefore I had to write my own _FindEGL.cmake_ which would not depend on **OpenGL**.
I was long baffled by undefined references in my code, until I realized that I need to import system libraries as **UNKNOWN IMPORTED** like this:
```cmake
if (NOT TARGET EGL::EGL)
    add_library(EGL::EGL UNKNOWN IMPORTED)
    set_target_properties(EGL::EGL PROPERTIES
        IMPORTED_LOCATION "${EGL_LIBRARY}")
endif()
```
I also had to specify custom location for _include_ directories for the **EGL** and **GLES** libraries (in _FindX.cmake_ files) like this:
```cmake
if (NOT DEFINED GLES2_INCLUDE_DIR)
    set(GLES2_INCLUDE_DIR "/opt/Native_SDK/include")
endif()

set_target_properties(OpenGLES2::OpenGLES2 PROPERTIES
    INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${GLES2_INCLUDE_DIR}")
```
And then export these libraries by the main library by adding them to **target_include_directories**, since we are probably not using them from the default system include directories.

It turned out that the BBB with Imagination image does not support the EXT extensions to **EGL** I was using on my host to enumerate possible devices to render to, so I decided to try my luck with two supported extensions allowing for creation of custom contexts.

In case you are interested, there is an [official document](https://github.com/powervr-graphics/Native_SDK/blob/master/docs/Architecture%20Guides/PowerVR.Supported%20Extensions.OpenGL%20ES.EGL.pdf) listing the supported extensions on PowerVR platforms.

For now I am trying rendering using a concept known as _render nodes_ which are special wrappers over regular device files for graphic cards. These allow for using the cards without creating a display - ideal solution for this project, **GPGPU**. 

In order to use these nodes we need to create **GBM** which is a Generic Buffer Management system, used to tie the high-level API calls to driver-specific calls. This requires usage of several extensions which fortunately are available on PowerVR SGX5xx platforms. Both the **GBM** device and a rendering surface are created using this API and then bound to the **EGL** rendering context via _eglMakeCurrent_ call.

---------------------

Since getting the context to work on BBB is tedious and may require more work which is not directly related to the library, I am developing the functionality of different API calls on the host and then I will port it to the target platform.
