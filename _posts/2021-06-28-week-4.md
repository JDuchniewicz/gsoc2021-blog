## Coding
### CMake polishing
I needed to update my CMake files to work properly with my BBB. It turned out that there is no OpenGL on the Imagination image for BBB and just EGL + GLES. Therefore I had to write my own _FindEGL.cmake_ which would not depend on OpenGL.
I was long baffled by undefined references in my code, until I realized that I need to import system libraries as **UNKNOWN IMPORTED** like this
```cmake
if (NOT TARGET EGL::EGL)
    add_library(EGL::EGL UNKNOWN IMPORTED)
    set_target_properties(EGL::EGL PROPERTIES
        IMPORTED_LOCATION "${EGL_LIBRARY}")
endif()
```
I also had to specify custom location for _include_ directories for the EGL and GLES libraries.
