## Coding
I tried rendering to a Pbuffer instead of regular surface on the device as proposed in the [issue comment](https://forums.imgtec.com/t/sgx530-argb8888-support/3403/5?u=jduchniewicz), however it did not work for me. Thus for now I will focus on polishing the API, to allow for operator chaining and adding broadcast operators. I also will try unrolling the loops as mentioned in the [2D convolution query](https://forums.imgtec.com/t/gradient-calculation-inside-a-conditional-block/3404/5?u=jduchniewicz).

----------------

I was able to implement the 2D convolution with the unrolled loops with some hurdles along the way. Notably, what worked on my host did not work on BBB so I had to debug the shader code. It turns out that I had to store the sampled texels in variables before using them for calculations. I would like to know why did it help and why it works on some machines and on some I have to make hacks like this ðŸ˜…. Maybe in time I will know...

I also updated the [benchmarking post](https://jduchniewicz.github.io/gsoc2021-blog/posts/2021/07/15/benchmarking.html) with the newly added 2D convolution calculation.
