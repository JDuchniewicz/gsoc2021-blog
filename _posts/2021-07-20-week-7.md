## Coding
I tried rendering to a Pbuffer instead of regular surface on the device as proposed in the [issue comment](https://forums.imgtec.com/t/sgx530-argb8888-support/3403/5?u=jduchniewicz), however it did not work for me. Thus for now I will focus on polishing the API, to allow for operator chaining and adding broadcast operators. I also will try unrolling the loops as mentioned in the [2D convolution query](https://forums.imgtec.com/t/gradient-calculation-inside-a-conditional-block/3404/5?u=jduchniewicz)
