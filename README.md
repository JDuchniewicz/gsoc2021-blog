## GSoC 2021 GPGPU with GLES blog

_Hi there!_

On this website you can find my progress with the project I am delivering through Google Summer of Code 2021 with BeagleBone - [the official project page.](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/5734780890513408)

Updates (and general thoughts) will come in a weekly fashion, intermingled with several blog posts which contain more structured information.
